This is the first day working on this project, so it will be spent adding files and starting to look for potential models.<br><br>

Added the default code from 5 phishing models found on hugging face. Of them, 4 provided easy setup code. May need to look elsewhere for more models if these turn out to not be very unique in their outputs or reliability scores found during testing.
