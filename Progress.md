This text document will detail my progress over time with this project.

This is the first day working on this project, so it will be spent adding files and starting to look for potential models.<br><br>

Added the default code from 5 phishing models found on hugging face. Of them, 4 provided easy setup code. May need to look elsewhere for more models if these turn out to not be very unique in their outputs or reliability scores found during testing.

Second day working on this and I have started to make a testing python file. This file will fill a list with a csv found from kaggle. Then using the models I have found, will pass the email body/subject/url into the desired model for testing. Each model's output will be printed and I will be able to see how the different models output their data/results.

Once I have this figured out more, I will change the code to test the results based on the kaggle answers in the csv.
